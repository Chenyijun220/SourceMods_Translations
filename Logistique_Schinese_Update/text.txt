My name is Ivanov and I'm a soldier.
I was on the frontline when the Seven Hour War began.
One after another, portals leading to another world opened in our skies.
An unstoppable power cut down our nations like lambs to the slaughter.
We quickly lost our sovereignty to this new threat.
Since that day, we have been colonized by the interdimensional force only known as...
The Combine.
I live in City 17.
Militray checkpoints and propaganda posters are everywhere you go.
We are rationed and domesticated like animals.
The Citadel is the symbol of their technological supremacy.
On June 7th, Combine Civil Protection forces came to our apartment.
They broke down the door and kidnapped my wife Anna.
They beat me to a bloody pulp and left me for dead.
